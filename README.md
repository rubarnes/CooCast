# CooCast

## What is CooCast?
CooCast is a wee podcast app for managing and listening to your podcasts.

## What will CooCast do?

### The basic scope for CooCast is to be able to:
1. Use a podcast's RSS feed to subscribe to it
2. Download podcasts for listening offline
3. Have a sleep timer based on either
  * Actual hours and minutes until pause
  * Number of full episodes
  * Closest number of episodes that can be played in a specified amount of time
4. Shuffle randomly between podcasts in either
  * A given podcast
  * Multiple given podcasts
  * Completely at random
5. Be able to queue episodes
6. Store the current state of play between listening sessions

### Stretch goals
1. Fancypants Bootstrap/Electron user interface
2. Listening statistics (who doesn't like nice graphs?)
3. Sharing your subscribed podcasts and other data with friends
4. Mac and Linux versions
5. moar

## But why?
Because I like software development, learning new technologies, and [Heilan Coos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_cattle).

Ok, it's not actually that wee. The overhead of using Electron and Node.js and other such fancypants new tech makes it quite a beefy (heh, beefy) app, but this is more of a learning exercise than anything else...
