# CooCast
## What is CooCast?
CooCast is a wee podcast app for managing and listening to your podcasts.

## What will CooCast do?
###The basic scope for CooCast is to be able to:
1. Use a podcast's RSS feed to subscribe to it
2. Download podcasts for listening offline
3. Have a sleep timer based on either
⋅⋅1. Actual hours and minutes until pause
⋅⋅2. Number of full episodes
⋅⋅3. Closest number of episodes that can be played in a specified amount of time
4. Shuffle randomly between podcasts in either
⋅⋅1. A given podcast
⋅⋅2. Multiple given podcasts
⋅⋅3. Completely at random
5. Be able to queue episodes
6. Store the current state of play between listening sessions
###Stretch goals
1. Fancypants Bootstrap/Electron user interface
2. Listening statistics (who doesn't like nice graphs?)
3. Sharing your subscribed podcasts and other data with friends
4. Mac and Linux versions
5.
##But why?
Because I like software development, learning new technologies, and [Heilan Coos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_cattle).
